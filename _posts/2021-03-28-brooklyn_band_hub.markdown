The last year without live music has, first, been extremely difficult for musicians and, second, on all of us who love live music.  Thinking back, though, as a resident of Crown Heights one of the frustrating things about the live music scene in Brooklyn was that there was often no notification of performances.  While the established clubs in New York have updated sites, so much music in Brooklyn happend at random bars, spaces, and even private homes.  I found out about four weekly performances only after they, and everything else, shut down.  I hope to avoid such in the future.  Thus my Sinatra MVC project is a bit aspirational.  When the music scene in Brooklyn reappears, it would be great if there was a place for local Brooklyn bands to register and let everyone know about their gigs--perhaps a site kinda similar to Brooklyn Band Hub.

The project was a challenge, but what struck me was how well the Playlister, NYC, and Fwitter labs prepared me to actually understand model relationships.  What I found out while working on Playlister is that I did not actually understand those relationships at all.  This lack of understanding led me to do what I should have been doing all along--paying close attention to the documentation.  Studying the Sinatra and Ruby documentation while working on those three labs proved invaluable when I started from scratch on my own project.  So much so that, while definitely not easy at all, the project came together a lot smoother than did aspects of those labs.  I said that to say what I'm sure most of you already know--the documentation will pull you out of many holes.
