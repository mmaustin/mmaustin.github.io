I came into the Rails project feeling pretty good about things.  I made it throught the Rails section with few hiccups, and I was fairly confident that the project would go smoothly.  Well, let's just say that the novice coder should never feel too confident--and the novice definitely should not go on a four day getaway between finishing the section and starting the project.  I came back from that four day break completely confused.  It took about three days for me to calm down and get back into any type of coding groove.

Once I became reoriented with things, I settled upon trying to make a mock tournament fishing app.  It would only have, or has, three models, with an Angler model as user.  The goal was to allow each angler to register any caught fish and add that fish's weight to their total catch weight.  I did not take certain issues into consideration--as I was not aware that they existed--when planning, but let's just say that updating an anglers total was not as simple as I had imagined.  Of course, looking back now it seems fairly simple, but during the process simple it was not.  Thankfully, the coding realm is full of validation attributes and work arounds, virtual attributes, and custom class methods.  While I did not appreciate the heartache while it was happening, I must say that I surprised myself that I was able to identify issues and come up with solutions--thought the app is still far from perfect and will, I anticipate, require improvements.

Everyone here knows as much or more about coding as I do, so I do not have any enlightening thoughts on that aspect of this project.  I can say, however, that when tested, as this project tested me, you will probably realize that you know at least a little more than you thought; and that's a big deal.
